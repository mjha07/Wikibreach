# Wikibreach
WikiBreach is an open source database that includes information on cyber breach events around the world from the 2005 through 2018 (with additional annual updates planned for the future). Unlike many other cyber breach event databases, WikiBreach plans to include systematic data on domestic as well as transnational and international cyber incidents that have occurred during this time period and will include hundreds of thousands of cases.
## Purpose

Wikibreach is a reliable, comprehensive platform for people to know about current and past cyber breach events. They can also learn what the effects of the cyber breach event will be on financial, education and business sectors. They will also see what the current public sentiment on twitter. The portal is optimized for mobile and desktop consumption. 
#### For Researchers and Analyst
WikiBreach was developed to be a comprehensive, methodologically robust set of longitudinal data on incidents of domestic and international cyber breach events. Its primary purpose is to enable researchers, analysts, and the public to increase understanding of the phenomenon of cyber breaches. WikiBreach is specifically designed to be amenable to the latest quantitative analytic techniques used in the social and computational sciences. The effects of the cyber breach on financial, education and business sectors can be seen through visualizations. Data can be downloaded in form of CSV. 
## Breach Codebook
